# Solo Hardware Wallet
This is a custom firmware for the [Solo Key](https://solokeys.com) that turns it into a cryptocurrency hardware wallet.

This is not fully featured and **HAS NO WAY TO BACK UP YOUR KEYS**

## WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS!
1. This is experimental software - it might break at any moment and you'll lose your coins
2. There is, as of yet, no way to back up your wallet - you lose the key, you lose the coins
3. In order to flash this, you need an unlocked version of the Solo key, which removes firmware signing. A bad actor can
   just reflash your key with firmware that exposes the private key.
